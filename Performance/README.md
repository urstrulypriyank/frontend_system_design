# WEB APPLICATION PERFORMANCE

We measure web performace in order to reduce the bottleneck which results in improved web page load time, and also the responsiveness of the page state.

The idea is to study the page performace to indentify the bottleneck.

** Better User Experinces retains visitors -> helps in achiving app goal.**

Until and unless you don't know where does the problem lies ,the effort to optimize go in vain or leads to success at heavy cost.

**Think of this as a doctor if you don't know where it hurts ? how would you proceed ?**

## Impact of performance in web application

    - Imporves UX
    - Helps in Revenue & Profitability (User Love engagement, can you bear sluggish experince )
    - If you don't think of perfromance -> Your app will bear high operational cost
    - SEO etc...
    - Reduction in Bounce Rate.
    - In Short Performant pages retain users.

performance and buisness success are related in one or other way.

One of the Most Important Question is How To Measure Performance ?
No Stop Watch won't help much.

There are **Performance metrics** to measure and compare performace

Do you know ?
redBus improved one perfomace metric (INP) and their sales increased by 7%

OR
BBC found out that they lost 10% of users for every additional second their site took to load

## Perormace Metrics
Earlier we talked about performance, But there is no One unique straight forward scale to measure performance, We tend to measure page performance relatively.
- A site might be faster for one user with bleeding edge machine + fast n/w but slow for another user on a slow 3g with low-end device.
- Two site finishes loading page at same time but one seems to load the content faster if it loads progressively
- In some case site becomes visible early but takes some time to become responsive.


We will be mainly exploring about: 
- User Centric Metrics (deals with UX).
- Browser Centric Metrics.
Neither of the way is better or worse. we generally use combination of both.

1. User Centric Metrics: 
The idea is to simulate Real User Monitoring(RUM) to compare performance
Here the metric represent the real behaviour experienced by the users.
The performance of a site can vary dramatically based on a user's device capabilities and network conditions.
eg: 
    FCP (First Contentfull paint) :



2. Browser Centeric Metric
The idea is to simulate the users with the help of numeros proxy and measure the performance and get the average of it.
