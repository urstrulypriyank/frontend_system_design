# Security

Security is the one of the most important part of the system design.
## why the hell frontend dev should learn security ? 
Most of the sql injection attack start from input box 
``` sql 
INSERT INTO trafficTickets (vechileNumber, ticketId, ticketCount) VALUES ('ZU 0666', 0, 0);
DROP DATABASE TABLE;
ðŸ˜ˆ
``` 
NOTE: Things evolved but earlier sql injection was a way, Now JSX does take care of this in react.

- Weak software often looses money due to bad code / design ( architecture ) or bad practices which results into data breaches or system hijacks. 
- In order to design a secure system first we must know about all the possible vulhneability or (exploits / bad peice of code )
